# Tissue simulation project

The goal is to simulate a tissue/beam interaction in MSI. Using mayavi to create an animation.

* Image formation model used to specify the beam/tissue interaction:

* Voronoi tesselation used to simulate cells coming together in a tissue. Inspired by the following papaer:
